## Objective

Write a method that can take any integer and add commas. For instance:

| Argument | Return Value |
|----------|--------------|
| 35       | 35           |
| 1051     | 1,051        |
| 609124   | 609,124      |
| 23482243 | 23,482,243   |

## Instructions

While this lab is test-driven, try thinking out how you're going to approach the problem. Once you have an idea, code it out and run `rspec` and get those tests to pass.

## Pointers

To get started on this lab, it might help to think about you, as a human, do when you have to add commas to a long number. There are a couple of different, eqally valid, approaches.

Let's say you have the number pi time ten to the tenth power, rounded to the nearest integer, or `31415926536`.

### Option One

One approach is to take the unformatted number and flip it around, then every three numbers, add a comma.

* 31415926536
  * flip it 
* 63562951413
  * add first comma
* 635,62951413
  * add second comma
* 635,629,51413
  * etc.
* 635,629,514,13
  * flip back around
* 31,415,926,536

### Option Two

Another approach could be to find the length of the string. Divide the length of the string by three, the number of digits that commas sandwich. Make that many multiples of four. Make every element in the array negative and insert commas at these indexes.

```ruby
number = "31415926536"

# find the total number of digits
num_of_digits = length of number

# divide num of digits by three
num_of_commas = num_of_digits / number of digits between commas
# num_of_commas should now equal 3

# make an empty array that will keep track of all the indexes where commas should be inserted

# num_of_commmas times find the next multiple of four of four and add it to the index array
# now the index array should be [4,8,12]

# make every element in the indexes array negative
# now the indexes are [-4,-8,-12]

# insert a comma at every index

# number should now be 31,415,926,536!
```

### Option Three

This functionality can also be achieved through one line of regex. Need to brush up on regex? Take a look at [Rubular](http://rubular.com/) and [Regex Crossword](http://regexcrossword.com/). If you really want to know how, try searching [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

### Other Options

There are probably many other ways to tackle this problem so if you don't see a strategy that you thought of listed on this readme, don't worry. It's probably also a legitimate way to approach this problem.

## Bonus

Once all your tests pass, take a look at [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/721415/2890716). What are positive lookahead assertions? How do they work?
